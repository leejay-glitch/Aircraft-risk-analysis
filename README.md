# Aircraft-risk-analysis
Analyzing aviation accident data to recommend low-risk aircraft for business.

## Overview
This project explores aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, with the goal of identifying low-risk aircraft models and conditions to give safer investment decisions in the aviation industry. 

## ðŸ“Š Business Understanding
### Stakeholders
- Aircraft investors
- Airline companies
- Aviation regulators

### Business Goal
To analyze historical accident data and provide actionable insights into:
- Aircraft makes/models with the least risk
- Conditions under which most accidents occur
- Severity patterns based on flight phase, weather, and other factors

## Data Understanding and Analysis
- **Source**: [Kaggle: Aviation Accident Synopses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)
- **Coverage**: 1962â€“2023
- **Important Fields**:
  - `Event Date`
  - `Location`
  - `Make` / `Model`
  - `Injury Severity`
  - `Weather Condition`
  - `Purpose of Flight`
  - `Broad Phase of Flight`
  - `Summary of event`

## Visualizations
_(To be added later in the project)_
